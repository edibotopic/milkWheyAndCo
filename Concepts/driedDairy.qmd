categories: [concepts, drying]

Foods like milk are complex mixtures of many different components.

Milk consists of almost 90% water along with molecules that can be substrates
for bacteriaal growth and enzymatic activity. For these reasons, milk is highly
perishable.

Drying milk is one of the simplest methods of producing stable dairy
ingredients, typically yielding a powder that will maintain an acceptable 
quality for approximately 24 months.

A necessary feature of any milk powder manufacturing process is that the
milk is dried to approximately 5% water.

When you are trying to recall how a given powder is manufactured, 
it can be useful to first write down the starting material and
then the final drying step.
All processes we will encounter have a specific input and
are finally dried into a powder.

To understand individual processes you will need to fill in
the steps between.
