Traditionally casein was separated from milk
by precipitation.
There are two broad approaches to precipitation:

- Chemical: isolectric precipitation using acid
- Biochemical: enzymatic precipitation using rennet

More recently physical methods of separation were
introduced, typically relying on membranes.
One advantage of physical methods is that they do
not generate an insoluble material.

Below is a general diagram that provides an
overview of the main casein-dominant ingredients
that can be produced using these methods along
with their co-products.
