Notes on Concepts are exploratory in nature and try to connect different ideas together.

They include facts but also some general discussion that provides additional context.

This can involve thinking why what we are learning is important and how we can approach
the topics.

Often they push us beyond the facts, as we try to find interesting connections or 
directions that engage our minds.
