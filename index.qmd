## Introduction

This website is used for the first half of the FS3016 course.

## Overview

The course can be broadly divided into three sections:

1. Introduction and commodity-type dairy products
2. Detailed overview of evaporation and drying technology
3. Speciality dairy ingredients and ingredient functionality

These will be covered — in turn — by Dr Shane Crowley,
Dr Tom O'Callaghan and Prof Seamus O'Mahony.

## Assessment

This module is delivered in the third year of your program,
which is truncated because of your work placements/internships.
For this reason, assessment is kept simple:

**There is one exam at the end of semester worth 100% of your marks.**
