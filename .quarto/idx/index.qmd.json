delivered in the third year of your degree program,\nwhich is truncated because of your work placements/internships.\nFor this reason, assessment is kept simple:\n\n**There is one exam at the end of semester worth 100% of your marks.**\n\n## The Website\n\nThe following sections provide some information on the\ndesign approach taken with the website.\n\n### Structure\n\nThese notes are designed according to the [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/) framework.\nThey are divided into four main categories:\n\n1. **Tutorials** aim to give you some practical knowledge about solving problems while you study the course.\n2. **How-tos** are short sets of instructions designed to help you achieve something.\n3. **Concepts** are exploratory in nature and try to connect different ideas together to form explanations.\n4. **Reference** notes are designed to give you concise, factual information.\n\nIn university courses these different sections are often mixed together, resulting in large bodies of\ntext that require students to adapt to different styles of thinking at regular intervals.\nDiátaxis allows these notes to be presented in smaller units that can be studied in isolation before\ncombining them together at a later stage.\n\nWhile studying the module you may find different sections more helpful than others.\n*References* are essential to learn factual material but can become dry and abstract.\n*Concepts* can be interesting and refreshing but challenging to grasp quickly.\n*Tutorials* can give insights into practical applications of knowledge but may not be immediately useful.\n*How-tos* can get you some practical results quickly but they are necessarily narrow in scope.\n\nWhile each section has its limitations they should work together to form an effective whole.\nEach student may choose to integrate the information in their own way and to give themselves\nthe best chance at succeeding in the assessment.\n\n### Formats\n\nThe notes are designed both for web and pdf.\nFiles in `.pdf` format will be made available (soon) to accompany the notes\n\nInteractive content, including slides and animations, is embedded\nwithin the notes in the web version (recommended).\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n\nFor example, you can click through the introductory slides below.\n\n<div>\n```{=html}\n<iframe class=\"slide-deck\" src=\"Slides/one/\"></iframe>\n```\n</div>\n\n:::\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"pdf\"}\n\nFor example, on the website this section includes\na set of interactive slides.\n\n:::\n\n### Sources\n\nThe course notes are published as an Open-Source repository on GitHub.\nIf you have a GitHub profile you are free to edit the material and submit your changes.\n\nAll diagrams are written in plain text in a `/Diagrams/` folder using the Mermaid and Dot languages.\n\nRecipes are created using the CookLang markup language in `/Recipes/`.\nThis allows them to be written in a style close to natural language\nbefore they are automatically parsed to generate lists of steps and tables of data.\n\nWith this setup it is easy to update diagrams and recipes, which can then be\ntranscluded from a single source to multiple outputs (e.g., slides, web, pdf).\n\n## Content\n\nListings are provided below for quick searching of module
