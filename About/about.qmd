Shane is a food scientist and technologist from Cork, Ireland.
He has worked full-time as an academic at UCC for seven years.

## Education

Shane has a PhD in Food Science & Technology and
a HDip in Philosophy, both from UCC.
During his PhD he did research on nutritional ingredient
development in UW-Madison, Wisconsin on a Fulbright scholarship.

## Teaching

Shane has taught food scientists, nutritional scientists and 
marketing students. He is interested
in the application of technology in food and nutrition, as
well as the exploration of how philosophy and programming 
can be applied to solving problems in food technology.

## Research

Shane's PhD thesis focused on the development of protein and
mineral ingredients for formulated nutritional products. More
recently he has become interested in the broad areas of food 
design, food philosophy and food digitilisation.

## Interests

Shane currently has a particular interest in software development and
technical documentation.
A recent example that combines these interests is his 
[article](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jchemed.2c01201)
on developing an interactive application that simulates Stokes' Law,
which is used by food scientists to study dispersed systems like
emulsions.
