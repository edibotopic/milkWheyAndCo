A general flow diagram for SCN is shown below:

The starting material can either be in powder 
or curd form, which has an impact on the initial
operations that are necesary.

A colloid mill increases the surface area of the acid casein
particles.
Alkali is added to resolubilise the casein.
High-shear mixing promotes the dissolution process.

Throughout the SCN process two parameters are important to
control:

- Solids: maintained <20% to prevent high viscosity
- Temperature: maintained at 50Â°C to reduce viscosity and promote solubility

As SCN forms a solution it can be dried using conventional spray-drying;
however, the solids content of the feed for the drier is much lower than
for other ingredients, like SMP.
Typically SCN is dried at around 20% solids, which is inefficient but
necessary due to the high viscosity of the material.
