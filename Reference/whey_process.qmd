```

Whey for processing into WP has been clarified and
pasteurised.

The whey is evaporated to 50-60% solids in an evaporator.

The concentrated whey is pumped into crystallisation tanks.

To promote lactose crystallisation the following conditions are required:

- Seeding with lactose crystals
- Gentle agitation
- Low temperature

These conditions are carefully controlled to ensure that 
a suspension of fine crystals is formed.

The concentrated, precrystallised whey is then spray-dried into a powder.
