```

Whey for processing into WPC has been clarified and
pasteurised.

The whey is ultrafiltered using a membrane with a MWCO
of 5-10 kDa.

As whey permeate is generate the volume of WPC is decreased
and the protein:lactose ratio increases.

For the highest protein contents diafiltration with water is required.

After ultrafiltration/diafiltration the WPC is concentrated and dried.
Care is taken during these thermal treatments to prevent excessive denaturation.
