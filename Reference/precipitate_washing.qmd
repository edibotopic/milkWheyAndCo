title: Multi-stage Washing
categories: [reference, casein, optimisation, water]
---

Precipitated casein ingredients — like ACN and RCN —
involve the separation of casein curds from liquid whey.
The casein curd needs to be washed to increase purity and
this often takes place in multiple stages.

If there is a washing stage $n$ the subsequent step $n+1$
will generate wash water with a lower residual lactose.
Fresh water only needs to be generated for the final washing stage.
This has the obvious benefit of reducing overall water use.
