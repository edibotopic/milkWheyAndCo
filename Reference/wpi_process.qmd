WPI can be produced in two ways:

1. Membrane filtration
2. Ion exchange

# Membrane Filtration

A general flow diagram for WPI by membrane filtration is shown below:

The composition of WPC and WPI, as well
as their underlying process of manufacture,
are subtly different, so be careful not to
mix them up.

Whey for processing into WPI has been clarified and
pasteurised.

The whey is microfiltered using a membrane with a pore-size
of 0.1 Âµm to remove residual fat and phospholipids.

The defatted whey is ultrafiltered to concentrate protein.
As whey permeate is generate the volume of WPI is decreased
and the protein:lactose ratio increases.

Diafiltration with water is required for the production of WPI using this method.

After ultrafiltration/diafiltration the WPC is concentrated and dried.
Care is taken during these thermal treatments to prevent excessive denaturation.

# Ion-exchange

<!-- TODO: a little bit too much detail? -->

The ion-exchange process is based on the fact that at a given
pH the majority of whey proteins have a similar charge (negative or positive).

When passed over a stationary phase consisting of reactive groups with the opposite
charge these proteins can be selectively bound while other components (e.g., lactose)
pass through unimpeded.

The proteins can subsequently be desorbed from the column, concentrated and dried.

For example, after adjustment to pH <4.6 most of the whey proteins are negatively charged.
The exception is GMP, which has a very low isoelectric point.
Choosing a column with a positively-charged set of reactive groups will
allow these proteins to be bound and subsequently recovered.

GMP is generated as an important coproduct of this proces.

After recovery the proteins will be quite dilute, so they typically require
ultrafiltration/diafiltration before drying.
