Milk for processing into Acid Casein (ACN) has been skimmed and
pasteurised.

The milk is pre-heated to 45-50Â°C.
Acid is added until a pH of 4.6 is reached.

Once sufficient time has passed for the formation
of curds and whey the mixture is separated using
a decanter centrifuge.

The decanter centrifuge generates a solid mass of casein
and liquid acid whey.

The casein is then processed in a washing tank to reduce
residual levels of lactose, salts and other components.
After washing the water is removed using a decanter
centrifuge.
For more detail on multi-stage washing view [this Reference note](./precipitate_washing.qmd).

Once the casein has been dewatered the casein material
is dried using an attrition drier or ring drier.

A fines-recovery system is often implemented
before drying to improve casein yield, as
described in [this Reference note](./fines_recovery.qmd).
This and other methods of optimising an ACN
process for casein yield are discussed in
[this Tutorial note](../Tutorials/caseinYield.qmd).
