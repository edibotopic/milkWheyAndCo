Reference notes are designed to give you information
with minimal extras or interruption.

There are deliberately concise in nature.

They are useful for getting the facts you need efficiently
and are a good starting point when learning a topic.

It is beneficial and interesting to round out the material
by reading some the 
[Concepts](../Concepts/concepts.qmd),
[Tutorials](../Concepts/concepts.qmd) and
[How-to](../Concepts/concepts.qmd) 
notes that are sometimes linked inside.
