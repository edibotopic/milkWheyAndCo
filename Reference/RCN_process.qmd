A general flow diagram for RCN is shown below:

```

Milk for processing into RCN has been skimmed and
pasteurised.

The milk is mixed with rennet and incubated.
Incubation is done at the optimal temperature
for chymosin, which is approximately 32Â°C.

Once sufficient time has passed for the formation
of curds and whey the mixture is separated using
a decanter centrifuge.

The decanter centrifuge generates a solid mass of casein
and liquid rennet whey.

The casein is then processed in a washing tank to reduce
residual levels of lactose, salts and other components.
After washing the water is removed using a decanter
centrifuge.

Multiple washing/dewatering cycles may be performed.
Multi-stage washing is discussed in more detail in
[this Reference note](./precipitate_washing.qmd).

Once the water has been removed the casein material
is dried using an attrition drier or ring drier.
