Processes for the manufacture of precipitated 
casein ingredients — like ACN and RCN — rely
on centrifuges to separate casein curd particles
from liquid whey.

The centrifuges used for dewheying and dewatering are not
100% efficient.
The recovered whey and water will often contain small
curd particles called "fines".

A "clarification" step is often applied to these streams.
This has two benefits:

1. Casein is recovered that can be reintroduced to the process to improve yield
2. Particles are removed from whey making it easier to process further

The fines that are recovered can be resolubilised by alkalisation.
The resultant soluble casein can then be mixed with milk that is
to be converted into acid casein.
